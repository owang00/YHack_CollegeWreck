Collaborative project for YHack 2019. Our project is targeted towards rising high school students transitioning into college applications. We strive to alleviate this stressful period by constructing an education focused website that provide users with three tiers of reccommended universities given their test scores and high school GPA. "Safety" tier reflect a high likelihood of acceptance given user's test scores and university data, "target" tier reflects reasonable chance of acceptance, and "reach" reflect low chance of acceptance. These factors and results are derived from an extensive university database powered by our dynamic Python and PHP scripts with web deign polished by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We hope to expand on this project to include more factors such as demographics and personal preferences accompanied by data analysis algorithms to provide students with a more comprehensive reccomendation.
